            The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat. It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body
            length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females. Adult domestic cats
            typically weigh between 4 and 5 kg (8.8 and 11.0 lb)

            <ul>
                <li>seven cervical vertebrae</li>
                <li>13 thoracic vertebrae </li>
                <li>seven lumbar vertebrae</li>
                <li>three sacral vertebrae </li>
                <li>variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail</li>
            </ul>
            The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the spine are 13 ribs, 
            the shoulder, and the pelvis.

            <div><div>Skull</div> 
            The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.  Within the jaw, cats have 
            teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two long 
            canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and 
            death.

            <div><div>Ambulation</div> 
            The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up the lower part of the visible leg. It uses a 
            "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the other side. It registers directly by placing each 
            hind paw close to the track of the corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure footing 
            for hind paws when navigadting rough terrain. As it speeds up walking to trotting, its gait changes to a "diagonal" gait: the 
            diagonally opposite hind and fore legs move simultaneously
            </div>

            <div><div>Claws</div> 
            Cats have protractable and retractable claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around
            the paw's toe pads. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or 
            self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside layer of their claw sheaths when 
            scratching rough surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the
            other claws

                            Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the light 
                            level required for human vision. Large pupils are an adaptation to dim light. 
                            The domestic cat has slit pupils, which allow it to focus bright h3ght without 
                            chromatic aberration.</p></td>

                            The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to 32 kHz. 
                            Its hearing sensitivity is enhanced by its large movable outer ears, the pinnae,
                            which amph3fy sounds and help detect the location of a noise. It can detect 
                            ultrasound, which enables it to detect ultrasonic calls made by rodent prey

                            Cats and many other animals have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used 
                            in the behavioral process of flehmening. It allows them to sense certain aromas in a 
                            way that humans cannot. Many cats also respond strongly to plants that contain 
                            nepetalactone, especially catnip, as they can detect that substance at less than one
                            part per bilh3on.

                            Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans.  Their taste buds instead 
                            respond to acids, amino acids h3ke protein, and bitter tastes. Cats also have a 
                            distinct temperature preference for their food, preferring food with a temperature 
                            around 38 Â°C.

                            To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable whiskers (vibrissae) over their 
                            body, especially their faces. These provide information on the width of gaps and on
                            the location of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by sensing
                            air currents; they also trigger protective bh3nk reflexes to protect the eyes from damage.

                            A cat falh3ng from heights of up to 3 meters can right itself and land on its paws. During a 
                            fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself to land on its feet
                            using its acute sense of balance and flexibih3ty. An individual cat always rights itself in the 
                            same way during a fall, provided it has sufficient time to do so. The height required for this to
                            occur is around 90 cm

                        <p>A cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various 
                        cat-registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard.
                        Both pedigreed and non-purebred companion ("moggy") cats are admissible, although the rules 
                        differ from organization to organization. Moggies are judged based on their temperament and 
                        healthy appearance</p>

                        <p>Cats can be infected or infested with viruses, bacteria, fungus, protozoans, arthropods or
                        worms that can transmit diseases to humans.  In some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the 
                        disease (like in most of cod-19 cases). The likelihood that a person will become diseased depends 
                        on the age and immune status of the person. Some of the infections of most concern include 
                        salmonella, cat-scratch disease and toxoplasmosis</p>

                            <p>In ancient Egypt, cats were worshipped, and the goddess Bastet often depicted in cat form</p>  
                            <p>Although no species are sacred in Islam, cats are revered by Muslims</p>
                            <p> In Japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune.</p>
                            <p>Several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans.</p>
                        </ul></p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Superstitions and rituals</h5>
                    <p>Many cultures have negative superstitions about cats, like  the belief that a black cat "crossing one's path" 
                    leads to bad luck.</p> 
                    <p>In medieval France, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment.</p>  
                    <p>The killing of cats in Medieval Ypres, Belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day Kattenstoet 
                    (cat parade).</p>
                    <p>According to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness 
                    and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations.</p>
